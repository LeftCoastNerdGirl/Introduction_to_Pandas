# pandas_challenge_v2

This challenge asks the student to import data schools size, type, and budget as well as a second file with reading and math scores for students in each of the schools. The goal is to provide analysis that will help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Data prep steps taken:  
-Use pathlib to import csv files  
-Use Pandas to store date in dataframes  
-Combine the data sets merging on school name

-Total number of students  
-Total budget  
-Average math score  
-Average reading score  
-Percent of students passing math  
-Percent of students passing reading  
-Percent of students passing both
